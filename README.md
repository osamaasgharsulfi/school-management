# School Management System

Welcome to the School Management System! 🎓 This project is a RESTful service built with NestJS and PostgreSQL, designed to handle school data efficiently. It leverages Docker for containerization, ensuring a seamless development and deployment experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: TypeORM
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Client**: Python (for REST client)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
